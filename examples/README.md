# Examples

## Evaluation
This example includes properties and commands to deploy Orkes Conductor along with its prerequisites for evaluation
purposes. It uses a standalone PostgreSQL database and Redis instance deployed via Helm charts. These configurations are
NOT production-ready and should only be used for evaluation.

## Security
This folder contains properties that can be added to a `conductor.properties` file to enhance security when deploying
Orkes Conductor in a production environment.
